### Hi there 👋

My name is Kalynovsky Valentin, call me Valik. Tell us about yourself:

Was born in 2001. I first got acquainted with a computer at the age of 5, from the age of ten I began to independently study computer literacy (there was no Internet then, and in a small town it was not necessary then, so I had to learn from my mistakes). Python became my first language. I began to learning it back in January 2018 during the winter holidays, but I did not go far on it (I could not learn much), and then I returned back to school and had to abandon it for the next year and a half. In 2020, I entered the Central Ukrainian National Technical University with a degree in _Computer Engineering_. At the moment, I am actively studying C++ and the Qt framework.

More details can be found in Autobiography 🇷🇺 :

## ♟️ Hobbies

My main occupation is programming, however, in addition to this, I also once studied origami (12-16 years old), drew (10-12 years old, then sometimes I sometimes drew a little until I was 17) and play [chess ♟️](https://www.chess.com/member/nakama3942) (from childhood until now). Origami has developed thinking and memory, drawing has developed a creative eye, and chess is developing thinking and logic. All these skills come to me in programming.

## ⚙️ My projects

I like to write standard programs like Notepad... Basically, now I'm working on my text editor. There are also several plans for another minor revision of two more of my programs - a utility calculator and a nickname generator. However, new projects from other spheres may appear in the near future. Maybe it will be a neural network, or maybe some kind of firmware for the controller...

## 📚 Study

I plan to learn Python and a few more languages, but let's get back to reality. I am currently learning C++. I know that some programmers studied the language for 5 years or even more, and then switched to other languages, realizing that they did not know this language perfectly. I am ready to spend so much time and even more on this programming language, and I don’t know - I’ll exchange it for another, but that’s another story...

In addition to C++, I also study the Qt framework in addition to C++. This is a great tool for writing GUI programs!

## 👅 Speak

My native languages: 🇷🇺 🇺🇦

I'm studying: 🇯🇵

I hardly know 🇬🇧 and use a translator.
